TODO
====


WORK IN PROGRESS
================
- Implement ttEntry cache
  - Fix cache usage
  - Make sure cache is fast enough --> old cache implementation (hashToStr) was
    3.5x slower than without cache (i.e., kN/s was 3.5 times less when cache ON,
    and up to 20x slower when
    cache goes over 1Gb)



BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
===================



IMPORTANT
=========
- Improve evaluation function (opening, middle, end)

- Razoring

- Ending tables (syzygy)

- Lazy SMP



WISH LIST
=========
- Read/write PGN files.

- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)
