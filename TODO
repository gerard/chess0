TODO
====


WORK IN PROGRESS
================
- Implement cache (ttEntry = hashkey + depth) --> cache doesn't save PV moves
  and therefore search starts anew from deeper depth (no iterative deepening
  data from previous cached moves, no sorting, etc, becomes slower)



BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
===================
- Edit board

- Save/load board



IMPORTANT
=========
- Fix weird moves (eval.cpp??), e.g., Rb1 or h3--Rh2 in the opening ??

- Replace BOOLTYPE with bool

- Improve evaluation function (opening, middle, end)

- Razoring

- Ending tables (syzygy)

- Fine-tune LMR



WISH LIST
=========
- Read/write PGN files.

- Lazy SMP

- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)
