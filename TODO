WORK IN PROGRESS
================
fen.cpp  / test.fen

- save:
  - boardToFEN() (implement FEN writer by looping on the board)
  - start by copying save() command from original chess0

- load:
  - FENToBoard() (use readFEN and setup.cpp) -- use setupFEN()
  - start by coyping load() command from original chess0



BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
===================
- Improve edit()
  - clean  up code
  - fix bugs
  - simplify

- Implement commands:
  - pass/null

- Implement ttEntry cache
  - use ttEntry class with fields for depth, ply, beta, alpha, score, lastPV,
    everything needed
  - use unordered_map() without a limit
  - index is U64 board.key
  - at every iteration, search by board.key and if ply > current ply, then use
    cached value, because accuracy must be higher
  - Make sure cache is fast enough --> old cache implementation (hashToStr) was
    3.5x slower than without cache (i.e., kN/s was 3.5 times less when cache ON,
    and up to 20x slower when
    cache goes over 1Gb)



IMPORTANT
=========
- Improve evaluation function (opening, middle, end)

- Razoring

- Ending tables (syzygy)

- Lazy SMP



WISH LIST
=========
- Read/write PGN files.

- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)
