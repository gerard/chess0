TODO
====


WORK IN PROGRESS
================
- Figure out how hashkeys are generated for board

- Implement cache

- Implement LMR




BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
===================
- Interface (input & output) should behave exactly the same as Chess0x

- Edit board

- Save/load board

- Implement benchmarks (nodes, moves, iterations, perft)



IMPORTANT
=========
- Cache support (using existing Zobrist hash tables)

- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)

- LMR support

- Lazy SMP

- 'cc' command never ends after a game is ended



WISH LIST
=========
- Read/write PGN files.

- Full BitBoard-based move generation and search.

- Multi-thread engine (i.e., top N moves, each goes to one thread)

- Think during opponent's time (dependency: transposition tables)
