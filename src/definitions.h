 * Different execution modes of Chess0:
 * - XBOARD: the program will be quiet and interact with a graphical user
 *           interface (GUI), by using the Winboard/Xboard protocol.
 *
 * - CLI:    the program will be verbose and interact with the user through the
 *           command line of the system, using text-based input and commands.
