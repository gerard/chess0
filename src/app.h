/*!
 * Cache implementation is rather rudimentary in chess0x. Instead of
 * using Least Recent Use (LRU) or similar, Chess0 simply keeps adding
 * new positions to the cache without any limit. This is due to the fact
 * that LRU introduces some delay when looking at the cache size and
 * doing the replacement itself. Since chess0x can use a few megabytes
 * even after a very long thinking, it should not go beyond the 1GByte
 * for 1h+ games. If someone complains about not having a limit for the
 * cache, then I'll implement some cache cleaning up functionality.
 *
 * Why unordered_map? Well, using std::map has the same behavior (plus
 * it allows LRU-like deletion of oldest items, due to its ordered
 * nature), however it is 3-8x times slower in most situations. Using
 * unordered_map the performance is greatly improved, brining around 20%
 * overall performance to the whole AI engine.
